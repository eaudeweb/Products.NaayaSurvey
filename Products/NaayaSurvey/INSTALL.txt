REQUIREMENTS
------------
NaayaSurvey uses the NaayaWidgets product.

CONFIGURATION
-------------
To be able to use NaayaSurvey in a Naaya portal, go to the portal's root in
the ZMI and add a "Naaya Survey Tool".
If the server has multiple Naaya sites, you can also use the
add_survey_tool_to_nysite naayaUpdater script.

MISC
----
Some of the charts are generated using the Google Charts API, so an Internet
connection is needed (charts won't work in an isolated LAN).
